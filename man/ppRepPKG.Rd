\title{ppRep: Bayesian design and analysis of replication studies using power
    priors}
\description{
The ppRep package features methods for design and analysis of
    replication studies using power priors assuming normality. Power priors
    are a useful class of informative prior distributions that allow to
    incorporate the data from the original study in the analysis of the
    replication data.
